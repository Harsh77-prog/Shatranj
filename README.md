# Shatranj

Shatranj is a feature-rich chess app built with Flutter, allowing users to play against the renowned Stockfish chess engine—one of the toughest AIs in the world. This project represents my first end-to-end product that went live in production, marking a significant milestone in my journey as both a developer and a product manager.

##  Project Highlights

- **Product Management**: As the sole Product Manager, I led all phases of the product lifecycle—from hypothesis testing, through alpha and beta testing, to launch, following best practices and requirements as set by the Google Play Store.
- **UI/UX Design**: The app’s interface was designed entirely by me, focusing on an intuitive yet engaging chess experience.
- **Monetization**: Integrated Google AdMob for monetization, which has already started generating revenue. While the initial earnings (₹3) may seem modest, it’s a proud demonstration of the app’s commercial viability and growth potential.
- **AI Chess Play**: Users can challenge themselves against Stockfish, providing a sophisticated and competitive chess-playing experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile framework for beautiful, natively compiled applications.
- **Dart**: Programming language for Flutter.
- **Stockfish**: Integrated as the chess AI engine.
- **Google AdMob**: For in-app advertisements and monetization.

## 📱 Features

- Play chess against Stockfish—the world's strongest open-source chess engine.
- Clean, user-friendly interface designed for both beginners and advanced players.
- Regular updates and improvements (Version 2 in progress).
- Google AdMob integration for in-app revenue.

## 🏗️ Development Process

This project was a hands-on journey through the entire product lifecycle:

1. **Hypothesis Testing**: Validated the idea and value proposition through research and feedback.
2. **Alpha & Beta Testing**: Followed rigorous testing phases as per Google Play Store requirements to ensure a stable and enjoyable user experience.
3. **Launch & Monetization**: Successfully published to the Play Store, implemented ads, and began generating revenue.

## 💸 Achievements

- **First Production App**: My inaugural project to reach the production stage and be published on the Google Play Store.
- **Revenue Generation**: Achieved my first app earnings via Google AdMob, a milestone that marks the start of greater commercial aspirations.

## 🚧 Roadmap
